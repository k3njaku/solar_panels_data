## Prerequisites

Before diving into the installation of Overpass API and Nominatim, it's essential to ensure your system meets certain prerequisites. This section outlines the operating system recommendations, software dependencies, and hardware considerations for a smooth setup process.

### Operating System:

While both Overpass API and Nominatim can be installed on various Linux distributions, this guide will primarily focus on **Ubuntu Server (latest LTS version recommended, e.g., 22.04 LTS or newer)**. Many community guides and Docker images are also based on Ubuntu/Debian, making it a common choice.

If you are using a different Linux distribution, the general steps should be similar, but package names and commands for installing dependencies might vary. For Windows or macOS users, it's highly recommended to use a virtual machine running Ubuntu or to utilize Docker, as direct installation on these platforms can be significantly more complex.

### Software Dependencies:

**1. For Overpass API (when not using Docker):**

   The Overpass API has several dependencies that need to be installed. The official documentation and community guides often list these. Key dependencies typically include:

   *   **A C++ Compiler:** `g++` is commonly used.
   *   **GNU Make:** For compiling the source code.
   *   **Expat library:** For XML parsing (`libexpat1-dev` on Ubuntu/Debian).
   *   **zlib library:** For compression (`zlib1g-dev` on Ubuntu/debian).
   *   **lz4 library:** For compression (`liblz4-dev` on Ubuntu/Debian).
   *   **wget or curl:** For downloading source files or data.
   *   **Standard build tools:** `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`, etc.

   You can typically install these on Ubuntu/Debian systems using `apt-get install <package-name>`.

**2. For Nominatim (when not using Docker):**

   Nominatim also has a specific set of dependencies:

   *   **PostgreSQL Server (version 9.3 or later recommended):** Nominatim uses PostgreSQL as its database backend.
   *   **PostGIS extension for PostgreSQL:** For handling geographic objects.
   *   **PHP (version 7.0 or later recommended) with specific extensions:** `php-pgsql` (for PostgreSQL connection), `php-intl`.
   *   **Web server (Apache or Nginx):** To serve the Nominatim API.
   *   **Utilities:** `git`, `build-essential`, `cmake`, `g++`, `libboost-dev`, `libboost-system-dev`, `libboost-filesystem-dev`, `libexpat1-dev`, `zlib1g-dev`, `libbz2-dev`, `libpq-dev`, `libproj-dev`, `lua5.3`, `liblua5.3-dev` (package names might vary slightly based on your Ubuntu version).

**3. For Docker-based installations:**

   If you choose to use Docker (recommended for easier setup and management), you will need:

   *   **Docker Engine:** Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. You can find installation instructions for your specific OS on the official Docker website (docs.docker.com).
   *   **Docker Compose (optional but recommended):** For managing multi-container Docker applications, which can simplify the setup of services that require a separate database.

### Hardware Considerations:

The hardware required will depend on the size of the OpenStreetMap data you intend to process and the expected load on your self-hosted services.

*   **RAM:**
    *   **Small extracts/Development:** A minimum of 4GB RAM is advisable, though 8GB or more would be better for smoother operation, especially if running multiple services or a desktop environment.
    *   **Full Planet Data:** For a full planet OSM import, especially with regular updates, significantly more RAM is needed. The main Overpass API instance, for example, uses 32GB. For Nominatim with a full planet, 64GB or even 128GB of RAM might be necessary for good performance during import and querying.
*   **Disk Space:**
    *   **Overpass API:** For a full planet with metadata and attic data, the Overpass API documentation suggests around 200GB - 300GB if using a compressed database. Without compression, this could be double.
    *   **Nominatim:** Importing a full planet file can require several terabytes of disk space. For Europe, it might be around 1-2TB, and for the entire planet, it could be significantly more (e.g., 2TB for data, plus space for the OS and other software). SSDs (Solid State Drives) are **highly recommended** over HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for both Overpass API and Nominatim due to the intensive read/write operations, especially during data import and querying. This will dramatically improve performance.
*   **CPU:**
    *   A modern multi-core processor is recommended. The more complex your queries or the higher the usage, the more CPU power will be beneficial.

**Recommendation for your project (Netherlands data):**

Given your project focuses on data for the Netherlands, you won't need to import the entire planet.osm file. You can use a regional extract (e.g., from Geofabrik). This will significantly reduce the hardware requirements, especially disk space and RAM for the initial import and subsequent operation.

*   **RAM:** 8-16 GB should be comfortable for a Netherlands-sized dataset.
*   **Disk Space:** An SSD with 200-500 GB should be more than sufficient for the OSM data, the operating system, and the software itself. Even 100GB might be enough if you are only importing a specific region like the Netherlands.
*   **CPU:** A modern quad-core processor should be adequate.

### Before you begin installation:

1.  **Ensure your system is up-to-date:** For Ubuntu/Debian, run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`.
2.  **Have `sudo` access:** You will need administrative privileges to install packages and configure services.
3.  **Backup any existing data:** If you are repurposing an existing server, ensure any important data is backed up before you begin.

By ensuring these prerequisites are met, you'll be well-prepared to follow the installation steps for Overpass API and Nominatim smoothly.
