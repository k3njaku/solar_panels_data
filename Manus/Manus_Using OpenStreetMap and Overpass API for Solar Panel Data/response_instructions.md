I have updated the Python script to populate missing address details (Street, Housenumber, Postal code, City) for buildings with solar panels in North Holland. The script now uses the Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) reverse geocoding service to find these details when they are not available directly from the initial OpenStreetMap data.

**How the updated script works:**

1.  It first queries the Overpass API to get a list of buildings in North Holland that are tagged as having solar panels (similar to the previous script).
2.  For each building, it checks if the address fields (Street, Housenumber, Postal code, City) are present in the OpenStreetMap tags.
3.  If any of these fields are missing, the script uses the building's latitude and longitude to query the Nominatim reverse geocoding API to attempt to fill in the missing address components.
4.  The script respects Nominatim's usage policy by including a User-Agent and adding a delay between requests to avoid exceeding the 1 request per second limit.
5.  The final data, including any newly geocoded address details, is saved to a CSV file.

**Attached Files:**

1.  `collect_solar_data_geocoded.py`: The updated Python script.
2.  `north_holland_solar_buildings_geocoded.csv`: The CSV output from a test run of the script, containing data for 37 buildings with address fields populated where possible.
3.  `example_output_snippet.csv`: A small snippet from the beginning of the output CSV to give you a quick look at the format.

**Instructions to run the Python script:**

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  Install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install requests pandas
    ```
3.  Save the attached `collect_solar_data_geocoded.py` script to a directory on your computer.
4.  Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
5.  Run the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python collect_solar_data_geocoded.py
    ```
6.  The script will then query the Overpass API, perform reverse geocoding where necessary using Nominatim, and generate/update a CSV file named `north_holland_solar_buildings_geocoded.csv` in the same directory.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Source & Accuracy:** The initial data comes from OpenStreetMap. The accuracy and completeness depend on the information tagged within OSM. Reverse geocoding via Nominatim also relies on OSM data and its interpretation.
*   **API Usage Policies:**
    *   **Overpass API:** This API has a Fair Use Policy. Avoid sending too many complex or frequent requests.
    *   **Nominatim API:** This API has a strict usage policy: **maximum 1 request per second**. The script includes a delay of 1.1 seconds between Nominatim requests to comply. You **must** also provide a descriptive User-Agent (the script includes a generic one, but for more extensive use, you might want to customize it with your project details/contact as per Nominatim's guidelines: `https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/`). Bulk geocoding is discouraged on the public Nominatim servers.
*   **Speed:** Due to the 1 request/second limit for Nominatim, processing a large number of buildings that require reverse geocoding will take time. For example, geocoding 360 buildings would take at least 360 seconds (6 minutes), plus the time for the initial Overpass query.
*   **Output Fields:** The CSV file includes the same columns as before, but the address fields (Street, Housenumber, Postal code, City) will be more complete if they were successfully reverse geocoded.
*   **Missing Data:** If Nominatim cannot find a specific address component (e.g., a house number for a general area), that field might still be 'N/A' or the original OSM value if it was better.

Please review the script and the output. Let me know if you have any further questions or require additional modifications!
